            <p>Hello! I'm Shreyas Nagi from pune. I'm considering pursuing Data Science and Economics from FLAME university and this is my E-Portfolio for Digital Literacy! My interests include-</p>

                    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
                    <p>Ever since I was young, I had an interest in mathematics and especially algebra. Even now, I'm considering pursuing a statistics field due to my affinity for mathematics. It is, in essence, a completely abstract concept and a product of the human mind, however, it's bought so much change to our real world which I find fascinating.

                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>Web development was the first field in computer programming that I ever learned and it immediately piqued my interests. I felt like I wanted to learn more and so I learned other programming languages such as python, php, C and some more.

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>Along with mathematics and programming, music has been another one of my interests ever since I was little. In specific, I've enjoyed playing the piano more than anything. I've learned a few western classical pieces by Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Beethoven and I'm try to learn more whenever I can get the time.

                    <h3>Cats</h3>
                    <p>Cats. I think cats are really cute and it's very rewarding when one approaches you. I love all the campus cats, however, my favorite has to be Bucky. I love Bucky :)
