                I have learned a lot from this course on Digital Literacy including skills, healthy practices, useful concepts and more. I appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of the topics this course teaches us since they’re all linked with the broader concept of information and data. We learn how to process, manage, communicate, evaluate and search for data/information using the various tools, practices and mental frameworks taught in the course. The importance of data is greatly highlighted, seeing how even the newly emerging AI technology is built entirely on the basis of data. This sudden abundance of data requires us to be mindful while we browse the internet and be careful with what we choose to believe in. Verifying sources has become incredibly necessary with how easy misinformation and wrong data can be produced and put out. There’s a need to also safeguard our data since data is essentially money in the digital age, hence, companies and malicious individuals will always try to get as much sensitive data on you as possible.
